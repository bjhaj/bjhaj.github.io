# Baaz Jhaj - Personal Website

A professional portfolio website showcasing my work in machine learning, edge AI, and autonomous systems.

## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at Arizona State University's Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering and Barrett the Honors College, graduating in 2025. I specialize in machine learning, edge AI, and autonomous systems, with a passion for translating academic research into practical applications.

Currently working as a Research Assistant on the DARPA TIAMAT project, developing neurosymbolic representation-based reinforcement learning for autonomous robot navigation.

## Featured Projects

### [SmokeNet](/smokenet) - Wildfire Detection System
A comprehensive wildfire detection system optimized for remote, no-service areas. Achieved over 6% higher accuracy than recent benchmarks while using a smaller, resource-efficient model. Features LoRa-based communication architecture and modular deployment library.

**Technologies:** PyTorch, LoRa, Edge AI, Hardware Acceleration, Model Optimization

### [Translatica](/translatica) - Speech-to-Speech Translation
2nd place winner at AI in Education Hackathon ($5,000 award). A modular speech-to-speech translation pipeline that preserves speaker identity, tone, and emotional prosody across 20+ languages. Features microservice architecture with real-time deployment capabilities.

**Technologies:** React, Vercel, NextJS, SupaBase, AWS Lambda, Python, PyTorch

### [SelfAlign](/selfalign) - Customizable LLM Alignment
A fully customizable alignment pipeline for large language models, giving users control over model persona and ideological alignment. Implements synthetic supervised fine-tuning and self-RLHF pipelines with visual interface for tracking alignment drift.

**Technologies:** LoRA/QLoRA, RLHF, Synthetic SFT
