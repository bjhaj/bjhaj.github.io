      <h2>About</h2>

      
      <p>I design systems that reveal truth about the world, and about ourselves.</p>

<p>Some watch for fires where no one else is looking. Some let us shape the beliefs we teach our machines instead of leaving them hidden. Some carry voices across languages without losing who we are. All are built to help people understand, decide, and act with clarity.</p>

<p>I work at the intersection of machine learning, edge AI, and human-centered design. My focus is on building systems that work where they’re needed most—off-grid camera networks that detect wildfires, speech translation tools that preserve identity across languages, and alignment pipelines that make model biases visible and deliberate.</p>

<p>When I’m not working, I’m training for a sub-5-minute mile, studying Japanese denim construction, or experimenting with model architectures—different crafts, same rule: nothing extra, nothing fake, only what earns its place.</p>

      <h2 class="resume-title">WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU</h2>
      <ul class="capability-list">
        <li><strong>Turn your biggest AI models into lean, deployment-ready systems</strong> that run anywhere—from solar-powered cameras in the desert to smartphones in your users' pockets</li>
        <li><strong>Build AI that works when the internet doesn't</strong>—edge systems that make critical decisions in real-time, whether detecting fires or processing speech</li>
        <li><strong>Make your AI transparent and controllable</strong> instead of a black box—so you can shape what it learns and trust what it decides</li>
        <li><strong>Bridge the gap between research papers and real products</strong>—taking cutting-edge techniques and making them work in the messy real world</li>
        <li><strong>Design systems that scale from prototype to production</strong> without breaking when they meet actual users and real data</li>
      </ul>
