## Project Overview

SmokeNet is a comprehensive PyTorch implementation of knowledge distillation combined with model quantization for efficient wildfire smoke detection. This project demonstrates how to train a compact student model using knowledge from a larger teacher model, then apply quantization techniques for edge deployment in wildfire monitoring systems.

**Key Achievement**: Over 6% higher accuracy than recent benchmarks while using a smaller, resource-efficient model optimized for remote deployment.
